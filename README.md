Visual-2C02-nodes
=================

Extra node names for the [Visual 2C02 chip simulator](http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/chipimages/visual2c02/), which simulates the NTSC
version of the NES PPU. Filled in as I explore.

To add the node names, download a local copy of Visual 2C02, drop the
nodenames\_extra.js file in the same folder as index.html, and add the following
line after the line for nodenames.js in index.html:

<pre>
<script src="nodenames_extra.js"></script>
</pre>
